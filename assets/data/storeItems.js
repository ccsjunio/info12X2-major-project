                comment: "Ordered another card to replace the returned fake one. This one tested ok. Lots of fakes out there so always test your cards with an app like “SD Insight” to make sure you have a legit card. You’ll save yourself a lot of grief In the long run. Third one of these I've purchased. First two tested ok with info about manufacturer, ser #, size and manufacture date ect provided when tested. This card tested with the result of 'invalid card' with no info about the card provided. Pretty sure it's a fake. Returned and will try another one."
