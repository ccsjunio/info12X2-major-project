Lots of fakes out there so always test your cards with an app like “SD Insight” to make sure you have a legit card. You’ll save yourself a lot of grief In the long run. Third one of these I've purchased. First two tested ok with info about manufacturer, ser #, size and manufacture date ect provided when tested. This card tested with the result of 'invalid card' with no info about the card provided. Pretty sure it's a fake. Returned and will try another one."

                commentTitle: "A Wyze Cam (v2) vs Wyze Cam Pan (v1) Comparison!",
                comment: "***** Review Update - September 17, 2019 ***** \
\
                An entire year has gone by since I initially posted this review and I was curious to see if a year worth of software updates had changed anything in terms of image quality so I retested the Wyze Cam Pan against the Wyze Cam v2 and was surprised and a little disappointed that my initial findings were still accurate.\
\
                That being said, there have been some improvements and things worth mentioning.\
\
                * Wyze has implemented person detection as a free feature which has helped to address the motion detection algorithm falsing during light transition changes. Person detection is fantastic as it also helps prevent alerts from squirrels and cars.\
\
                * The two way audio through the cameras have improved by leaps and bounds.\
\
                * Wyze has added two-factor authentication to Wyze accounts for better security. This is great as it helps to prevent people from getting access to your account and being able to view your cameras.\
\
                * Viewing of cameras can be shared across different Wyze accounts. This is handy for being able to view cameras at different physical locations on a single account. We keep a camera at the grandparents in the kids room so when the kids are staying over, we can spy on them to make sure they're behaving and napping when they should be.\
\
                * Although this is a \"do so at your own risk\" and it is not something I am endorsing nor will assume responsibility for if your Wyze Cam should pack it in, I have multiple friends that have mounted their Wyze Cams outdoors under the soffet without using a third party cover and the cameras have survived even through a Canadian winter."

        description : "Wyze Cam v2 delivers fast, clear, live stream footage direct to your smartphone via the Wyze App (iOS and Android), day or night. You can receive an alert anytime your Wyze Cam v2 detects sound or motion and view up to 14 days of saved alert videos for free - no monthly fees or subscription required. Use the Wyze Cam v2’s new Motion Tagging feature to easily identify motion in both live stream and playback video modes. Plus, you can add an 8GB, 16GB or 32GB microSD card (sold separately) to enable continuous recording, schedule custom time lapse videos, use 2-way audio to talk, and listen through your Wyze Cam v2. Use the Wyze App to manage and view multiple cameras, share your cameras with other users, view alert videos, and record and share photos and videos directly from the app. With its small size, magnetic base, and flexible 3-axis design, the Wyze Cam v2 can go anywhere you need it.
